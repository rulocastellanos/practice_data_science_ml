# Intro

I want to practice and improve my Data Science and Machine Learning skills. 

I took this list as a [starting point.](https://medium.com/coders-camp/180-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-python-6191bc7b9db9) But I started doing ML and Data Science Videos I found intersting also in Youtube. 

# List 

1. [Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbTU92pbDKw) available as AXON_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTMs.ipynb
2. [House Price Prediction in Python - Full Machine Learning Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmtf9SA_kk) available as House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
3. [Income Prediction Machine Learning Project in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhoKFqhVJu0) based on the [Adult income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset) available at Kaggle. **What was the objective?** To know what are the variales that determine the most the income of an adult. **What did I practice?** I practiced One Hot Encoding for creating dummie variables. Then I did a correlation table to see the variables that are more correlated to income. In this part I also made a zoom to stay with the features that have a higher correlation with income (above 80%). I split the data into ntrain and tes (I choose the 20% test size). I then did a Random Forest Classifier and finished with a score of 84%. I then performed a Hyperparameter tuning to find the model that fits the most my data. I used different n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split and max_features based on the [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).After tune modeling the score of the model was 86%. **Where to find my code?** [Check this link.](https://github.com/rulocastellanos/practice_data_science_ml/blob/main/Adult_income.ipynb)
4. [Flight Price Prediction in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMoLTicNR6w) **What was the objective?** The objective of the study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. **What did I practice?** Preprocesing, creating one hot encoding, creating a Random Forest Model, creating predictions based on test, Creating ussing mathplotlib a regression line. **Where to find my code?** [Check this link.](https://github.com/rulocastellanos/practice_data_science_ml/blob/main/Flight_Price_Prediction.ipynb)
5. [Automated Text Summarization Using NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NabFGP4yLnk&list=PL_1pt6K-CLoCM3kyfOfsX5vn-_U8w9b4H) **What is the objective?** Summarazinf the key ideas of a text using 2 techniques: the extractive text and abstractive text summarization. **What did I practice?** Tokenize the words removing stopwords using 2 different techniques. Calculate the frecuency of each word. Normalizing the frequency oof each word. Creating a score for each sentence and Summarization using transformers.**Where to find my code?** [Check this link.](https://github.com/rulocastellanos/practice_data_science_ml/blob/main/Automated_Text_Summarization_Using_NLP.ipynb)
