# Intro

I want to practice and improve my Data Science and Machine Learning skills. 

I took this list as a starting point. https://medium.com/coders-camp/180-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-python-6191bc7b9db9 But I started doing ML and Data Science Videos I found intersting also in Youtube. 

# List 

1. [Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbTU92pbDKw) available as AXON_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTMs.ipynb
2. [House Price Prediction in Python - Full Machine Learning Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmtf9SA_kk) available as House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
3. [Income Prediction Machine Learning Project in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhoKFqhVJu0) based on the [Adult income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset) available at Kaggle. This is a KNN dataset.
