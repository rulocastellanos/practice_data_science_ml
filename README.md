# Intro

I want to practice and improve my Data Science and Machine Learning skills. 

I took this list as a starting point. https://medium.com/coders-camp/180-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-python-6191bc7b9db9 But I started doing ML and Data Science Videos I found intersting also in Youtube. 

# List 

1. [Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbTU92pbDKw) available as AXON_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTMs.ipynb
2. [House Price Prediction in Python - Full Machine Learning Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmtf9SA_kk) available as House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
3. [Income Prediction Machine Learning Project in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhoKFqhVJu0) based on the [Adult income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset) available at Kaggle. **What was the objective?** To know what are the variales that determine the most the income of an adult. **What did I practice?** I practiced One Hot Encoding for creating dummie variables. Then I did a correlation table to see the variables that are more correlated to income. In this part I also made a zoom to stay with the features that have a higher correlation with income (above 80%). I split the data into ntrain and tes (I choose the 20% test size). I then did a Random Forest Classifier and finished with a score of 84%. I then performed a Hyperparameter tuning to find the model that fits the most my data. I used different n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split and max_features based on the [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).After tune modeling the score of the model was 86%. **Where to find my code?** [Check this link.](https://github.com/rulocastellanos/practice_data_science_ml/blob/main/Adult_income.ipynb)
